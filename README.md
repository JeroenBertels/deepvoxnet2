# DeepVoxNet2
Deep learning processing framework for Keras.
Partly based on [DeepVoxNet](https://github.com/JeroenBertels/deepvoxnet).

## Get started
This package can be added to your 3.6 <= python <= 3.8 environment via:
- First cloning/downloading the repository and then via:
```
pip install -e /path/to/deepvoxnet2
```
- Installing it directly from Github via:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/JeroenBertels/deepvoxnet2
```
To upgrade your installation using the first method just download the latest version and repeat the process or ```git pull``` the new version. When using the second method simply repeat the command but add the ```--upgrade``` flag. You can also install/revert to a specific version; in that case append ```@version_tag``` (e.g. @deepvoxnet-2.5.3).
